PhonePresentator
==========================
A node script that helps you to present your slides, so no need of a presentator device, just deploy and use your phone by accessing to the
website.


It only works in computers with Windows and NodeJS (_sorry!_).

Usage
=======
1. Connect your phone and the computer you're using to present to a local network (WiFi)
1. ~~Download and install dependencieas~~ (but they're included in the repository so its not necessary)
2. Run: ``` node index ``` 
3. Go to your local IP and access the _port 3000_
4. Open your Power Point presentation and run it.
5. Use the buttons on the smartphone to go to the next or previous slides.
